This project aims to Analyze Box Office Data using different Visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly using Python.

As we know that the Revenue generated by a Movie is important. There are many factors affecting Revenue, which needs to be analysed to increase chances of a movie generating the highest Revenue and This project does exactly that.

About the files-
- The code File holds the code of the Analysis Done.
- The data file contains train and test data.
- The Pyplot files holds the Scrrenshots for the Pylots, as in github the plot cant be seen. 

This Project is guided by Snehan Kekre.

And I will be adding more to this project, in comming days.

Happy Learning ! :)
